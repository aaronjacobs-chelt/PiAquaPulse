We take the security of PiAquaPulse seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
2. Email the details to git@aaronemail.xyz including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### What to Expect

- Initial response within 48 hours
- Regular updates on the progress
- Credit for responsibly disclosing the issue (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Coordinated disclosure once the issue is resolved

## Security Best Practices

When deploying PiAquaPulse, follow these security guidelines:

### Physical Security
- Secure all hardware components in tamper-resistant enclosures
- Restrict physical access to the Raspberry Pi and sensors
- Use waterproof enclosures with proper sealing
- Consider GPS tracking for deployed units in remote locations

### Network Security
- Use a dedicated network when possible
- Keep Raspberry Pi OS updated with latest security patches
- Secure your Wi-Fi network with WPA3 encryption
- Disable unnecessary network services
- Consider VPN access for remote monitoring

### System Security
- Use strong passwords for Pi user account
- Regularly backup configurations and data
- Monitor system logs for unusual activity
- Limit sudo access as needed
- Keep Python dependencies updated

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data if required by your use case
- Implement secure data transfer methods
- Consider data retention policies
- Backup important sensor data regularly
- Sanitize data before sharing publicly

### GPIO and Hardware Safety
- Follow proper GPIO handling procedures
- Use appropriate voltage levels for all sensors
- Implement hardware failsafes where possible
- Isolate power supplies as needed
- Test all connections before field deployment

## Field Deployment Security

### Remote Locations
- Use cellular or satellite communication where Wi-Fi isn't available
- Implement tamper detection if units are deployed unattended
- Consider solar charging with battery backup for extended deployments
- Plan for secure data retrieval from remote units

### Environmental Protection
- Use appropriate IP ratings for enclosures
- Protect against electromagnetic interference
- Consider temperature and humidity ranges
- Plan for extreme weather conditions

## Emergency Procedures

In case of security incidents:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disconnect network access if compromised
   - Document the incident thoroughly
   - Preserve logs and evidence
   - Assess the scope of potential data exposure

2. **Assessment:**
   - Check physical integrity of hardware
   - Review system logs for unauthorized access
   - Verify data integrity
   - Check for unauthorized modifications

3. **Recovery:**
   - Restore from known good backups if needed
   - Update passwords and access credentials
   - Apply security patches as needed
   - Resume operations only after verification

4. **Contact Support:**
   - Email: git@aaronemail.xyz
   - Subject: "PiAquaPulse Security Incident"
   - Include incident details and timeline

## Updates and Patches

- Security updates are released as needed
