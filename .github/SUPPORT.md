## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Sensor Not Detected
- Verify GPIO connections match the documentation
- Check that required interfaces are enabled (SPI, I2C, 1-Wire)
- Ensure sensors have proper power supply
- Test with a multimeter if needed

#### 2. GPS Not Working
- Ensure GPS module has clear view of sky
- Check UART configuration in `/boot/config.txt`
- Verify TX/RX connections are correct
- Allow time for GPS fix (can take several minutes)

#### 3. pH Sensor Inaccurate
- Calibrate with known buffer solutions (pH 4.0, 7.0, 10.0)
- Check sensor probe condition
- Verify analog connections to MCP3008
- Temperature compensation may be needed

#### 4. Data Logging Issues
- Check file permissions in data directory
- Ensure SD card has sufficient space
- Verify CSV file format is not corrupted
- Check system time/date configuration

#### 5. Power Issues
- Monitor power consumption with sensors active
- Check battery voltage levels
- Ensure adequate power supply for all components
- Consider power-saving optimizations

### System Diagnostics

Run these commands to gather diagnostic information:

```bash
# Check system status
sudo systemctl status piaquapulse.service

# View recent logs  
sudo journalctl -u piaquapulse.service -n 50

# Check GPIO status
gpio readall

# Test SPI interface
ls /dev/spi*

# Check 1-Wire devices
ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/

# Test UART
sudo cat /dev/ttyS0
```
